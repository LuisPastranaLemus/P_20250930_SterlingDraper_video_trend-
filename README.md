## 📚 Guided Foundations (Historical Context)

The notebook `00-guided-analysis_foundations.ipynb` reflects an early stage of my data analysis learning journey, guided by TripleTen. It includes data cleaning, basic EDA, and early feature exploration, serving as a foundational block before implementing the improved structure and methodology found in the main analysis.
